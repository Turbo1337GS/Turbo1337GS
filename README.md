## Hi, I'm Tomasz Kolk - a Professional Coder! :computer:

### About Me
A passionate software engineer and backend developer, I have been immersed in the world of programming since the tender age of seven. This early start gave me a deep understanding of coding, its logic, and a unique ability to master new languages swiftly.

### Skills and Expertise
- 💻 Backend Development: Proficient in C++, PHP, C, and SQL.
- 🛠️ Software Engineering: Experienced in multiple programming languages and comfortable in both Linux and Windows environments.
- 🖥️ Operating Systems: Knowledgeable about Linux and Windows from a developer's perspective.
- 🗄️ Database Management: Skilled in creating, querying, and managing SQL databases.
- 🔍 Problem Solving: Strong problem-solving skills, comfortable with debugging and resolving complex coding issues.
- 🌱 Future Learning: Always open to learning new frontend and UX/UI concepts to enhance my skills and proficiency.

### Programming Languages I Love ❤️
- C++: My forte, honed throughout my academic and professional career.
- Python: Well-versed in Python, can easily refresh my skills.
- TypeScript: Currently expanding my knowledge base by learning TypeScript for its flexibility and static typing, complementing my experience with C++.

### What I Do Best 👨‍💻
While I have some exposure to UI, backend development is where my passion and strength lie. I excel in working behind the scenes, creating robust engines that power applications. I enjoy building and managing the technologies that drive user-facing components.

### My Future Goals 🚀
In the future, I plan to open GigaSoft, my own software development company. Leveraging my command of C++/PHP/TypeScript, I aim to create software solutions in various categories:

1. Security: Developing robust and secure software solutions to protect sensitive data and systems.
2. Video/Audio Editing Tools: Creating intuitive and feature-rich tools for editing and manipulating videos and audio files.
3. System Utilities: Designing small utility applications such as shared folders across multiple computers or remote computer control.
4. Developer Tools: Building software specifically tailored for developers, such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and debuggers.

Additionally, I believe in incorporating cutting-edge technologies and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance software functionality and user experience. By continuing to learn and staying updated with industry trends, I aim to deliver innovative and forward-thinking software products that meet the specific needs and challenges faced by businesses and individuals.

### My Projects and Learning Journey 📚
- First Big Project - Custom SI ([Check it out!](https://main.gigasoft.com.pl/AI)): Based on the BERT model, I created my own Chatbot-AI, written in PHP, TypeScript, and a bit of C++. This is my biggest project to date, pushing the limits with a token limit of 10,000!
- Learn JS/TS: As JavaScript gained popularity, I expanded my skills in web development, particularly focusing on UI and utilizing frameworks for design.
- First Projects: Started working on my initial small projects, primarily using C++, Python, and PHP. These projects included simple websites and client applications, utilizing the curl library in C++ for network connections.
- Learn Python: Attained intermediate proficiency, allowing me to create simple scripts for various purposes.
- Learn PHP: Acquired knowledge of PHP to develop applications with network connections, expanding my programming capabilities.
- Beginning to Learn Programming ([cpp0x.pl](https://cpp0x.pl)): Started my programming journey at the age of seven, primarily learning C++ from the cpp0x.pl website.
